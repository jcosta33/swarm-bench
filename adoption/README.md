# Adoption walkthroughs (Tier 2)

Seven **verified illustrative walkthroughs** of the pick-and-choose Swarm adoption paths — one per
persona × adopted-subset, spanning **minimal (1 part) → full (everything)**.

## What these are (and are not)

- **They are verified illustrations.** The product and persona in each are fictional, but the **Swarm
  surface they traverse is real** — every command and its output was *actually executed* against the
  current `swarm` binary, the built `swarm-mcp` server, and the `swarm-skills` catalog, and pasted
  verbatim. Each walkthrough's top banner says exactly what was executed.
- **They are not field-audit evidence.** A fictional product cannot honestly yield *adoption-friction
  findings* — that needs a real adopter (Phase 2; the existing `swarm-hq/specs/adoption-experience/` Yap +
  Promptly audits are the real-product precedent). So "Documented gaps" here are limited to **checkable
  surface facts** (a real CLI message, a real doc/npm mismatch, by path); any UX hunch is explicitly
  labeled a *hypothesis (unverified)*, never a finding.
- **One frame throughout** — Documentarian (illustrate the path). No verdicts, no marketing.

## The seven

| # | Walkthrough | Persona | Adopts | Executed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [review-only](./01-review-only/walkthrough.md) | Tech lead, specs in Linear | review packet only | — (markdown) |
| 2 | [greenfield-formats](./02-greenfield-formats/walkthrough.md) | Solo dev, new SaaS | spec+task+review+finding | — (markdown) |
| 3 | [brownfield-navigator](./03-brownfield-navigator/walkthrough.md) | Eng, 80k-LOC refactor | + inventory + change-plan | `swarm check` |
| 4 | [cli-mechanized](./04-cli-mechanized/walkthrough.md) | Dev mechanizing the loop | kit + swarm-cli | full CLI loop |
| 5 | [mcp-agent-queries](./05-mcp-agent-queries/walkthrough.md) | Team on Claude Desktop/Cursor | + swarm-mcp | real MCP over stdio |
| 6 | [skills-conditioning](./06-skills-conditioning/walkthrough.md) | Dev wanting stances/guides | + swarm-skills | real install (npx + copy) |
| 7 | [full-stack-team](./07-full-stack-team/walkthrough.md) | Team adopting everything | all + hooks + conventions | CLI + MCP + skills + hook |

See [overview.md](./overview.md) for the pick-and-choose map and the collected checkable gaps.

## Phase 2 — build real demos from these

These illustrations are written to **seed real demo products**: each ends with a "To make this a real demo"
note. Phase 2 turns the fictional premises into actual throwaway builds where the friction is *real*, with
**Yap as the brownfield real-adoption example** (walkthrough 3's natural slot). The verified-illustration
tier here is the honest starting point; the real demos are the field evidence.
